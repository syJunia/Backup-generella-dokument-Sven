Main sail

Leech today 475 cm
Foot today 210 cm
Luff today 410 cm 
today 3 battens and 1 reef 75 cm up from the foot.
Rope attcahing the leech side towards the mast
that goes into the mast is 7 mm thick. (No slides)
a Rope at the foot as well - but that doesnt slide in the boom.

I would like Luff 410, Foot 210, But a longer Leech eg a small 'Fat Top' and also an arc which makes a larger sail 
and longer leech.

2 full battens and 2 short battens.
2 reefs : one 75 cm from the foot and a second reef perhaps 40 cm above the first reef. (105 cm up) 


Jib sail

Side against the forstay: 325 cm = luff
Foot side 142 cm today
Other side 240 cm today = leech
6 clams  for a  4 mm forstay - first Clam today 45 cm up from foot
I would like a larger Jib as well Forstay side and number of clams should stay
We can increase the Foot and the side of the jib/genoa with at least 30 cm.

I'd like telltails and possibly window as well on both the jib an the mainsail
